### What does one understand by the term Data Science?
An interdisciplinary field that constitutes various scientific processes, algorithms, tools, and machine learning techniques working to help find common patterns and gather sensible insights from the given raw input data using statistical and mathematical analysis is called Data Science.
- It starts with gathering the business requirements and relevant data.
- Once the data is acquired, it is maintained by performing data cleaning, data warehousing, data staging, and data architecture.
- Data processing does the task of exploring the data, mining it, analyzing it which can be finally used to generate the summary of the insights extracted from the data.
- Once the exploratory steps are completed, the cleansed data is subjected to various algorithms like predictive analysis, regression, text mining, recognition patterns, etc depending on the requirements.
- In the final stage, the results are communicated to the business in a visually appealing manner. This is where the skill of data visualization, reporting, and different business intelligence tools come into the picture.

### What are some of the techniques used for sampling? What is the main advantage of sampling?
Data analysis can not be done on a whole volume of data at a time especially when it involves larger datasets. It becomes crucial to take some data samples that can be used for representing the whole population and then perform analysis on it. While doing this, it is very much necessary to carefully take sample data out of the huge data that truly represents the entire dataset.
There are majorly two categories of sampling techniques based on the usage of statistics, they are:
- **Probability Sampling techniques:** Clustered sampling, Simple random sampling, Stratified sampling.
- **Non-Probability Sampling techniques:** Quota sampling, Convenience sampling, snowball sampling, etc.

### List down the conditions for Overfitting and Underfitting.
- **Overfitting:** The model performs well only for the sample training data. If any new data is given as input to the model, it fails to provide any result. These conditions occur due to low bias and high variance in the model. Decision trees are more prone to overfitting.
- **Underfitting:** Here, the model is so simple that it is not able to identify the correct relationship in the data, and hence it does not perform well even on the test data. This can happen due to high bias and low variance. Linear regression is more prone to Underfitting.
