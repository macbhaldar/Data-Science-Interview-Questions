There is no limit to the dataset for the direct query method, and a 1GB dataset limit is not applicable in this method.

### What is the incremental refresh in the context of Power BI?
Incremental refresh is used to refresh the newly added data to avoid truncating and loading data.

### What is the difference between a Filter and a Slicer?
Filters are used to restrict users and not allow them to interact with dashboards or reports, while the slicers are used to interact with dashboards and reports.

### What are the different joins in Power BI?
There are mainly two types of joins in Power BI:
- **Horizontal Joins**: Horizontal Joins are used to append data from multiple tables.
- **Vertical Joins**: Vertical Joins are used to merge the data from multiple tables.
